Point of sales for mobile stores

Description
=================

This small point of sales focused for small mobile phones will help the owner of said store or stores to have a better control
of their sales, guarantees, repairing services, among other things such as generate reports of daily sales.

This small project also contains the administrator module. If the administrator visits each store often, they will be able to retrieve anything they need of the store or the other stores.

Updates

25/01/2014: 
  * There are some cute icons instead of solid buttons.
  * I have added a module for the owner of the stores. I just need to work on some forms for that module.
  * Redesigned database [will be uploaded as soon as I make sure it works properly.]

26/01/2014:
 * Admin can add new phones to every store they decide.
 * I'm working on the "Summary" section which will be the main form. Some statitics can be found here, such as best selling phones and less sold phones too.
